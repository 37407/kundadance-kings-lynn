    <h1>KundaDance速 Classes with Ellie in King's Lynn</h1>
    <p>KundaDance速 is a 60-minute, fun, uplifting, cardio and dance workout developed by Maya Fiennes. It is a creative movement class that combines Kundalini Yoga, Tai Chi and Qi Gong, meditation and breathing. It is both energising and calming and brings balance to the body, mind and soul.</p>
    <p>No dance, yoga or tai chi experience required - just comfortable clothing for movement and a bottle of water.</p>
